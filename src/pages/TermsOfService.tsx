            <p className="mb-4">
              KloudFox automatically checks the monitors defined by you in user-defined intervals. And, once a downtime is detected, it can notify the "user-defined contacts" with various methods (like email, SMS, mobile push messages, etc.). The monitoring methods include:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-6 space-y-1">
              <li>HTTP(s)/website monitoring</li>
              <li>Keyword monitoring (checking the existence or non-existence of a given keyword on a web page)</li>
              <li>Ping monitoring</li>
              <li>Port monitoring</li>
              <li>Heartbeat monitoring (cron-job monitoring, you send requests to KloudFox and we check if they arrive on time)</li>
              <li>Status pages (showcase your uptime to your customers)</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Payment and Renewal</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              Optional paid services such as extra monitors, extra seats, shorter monitor intervals, or extra SMS message/voice call credits are available on the products (any such service is considered an "Upgrade"). By selecting an Upgrade you agree to pay KloudFox the monthly or annual subscription fees indicated for that service.
            </p>

            <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mt-8 mb-4">Refunds</h2>
            <p className="mb-6">
              You may terminate your subscription to the Upgrade at any time and you will not be obligated to pay any additional fees for upcoming subscription renewal periods. However, any subscription fees you have paid in advance will not be refunded unless there have been 10 days or less since the payment. For payments made in the last 10 days or less, only those payments are refundable.
            </p>
